## renren-fast-vue
- renren-fast-vue is built on Vue and Element UI, and implements the front-end functionality of the renren-fast management system, providing a better front-end solution.
- Front-end and back-end are separated, and data interaction is performed through tokens, which can be independently deployed.
- Theme customization is achieved through SCSS variables for one-stop customization.
- Dynamic menu management unifies the management of access routes.
- Data switching is achieved by configuring mock interfaces to switch between interface data and mock data.
- During release, static resources can be dynamically configured for CDN or to switch between old and new versions.
